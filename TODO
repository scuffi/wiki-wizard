Todo:
  ☐ Modularise functionality -> allow for total configuration for easier testing, e.g. passing what functions get called in what areas
  - Improve CompletePipeline, feels very messy atm, make it cleaner and more understandable
  - Make functionality less specific, all functions are too coupled atm
  - Change ugly print statements
